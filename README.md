Our project focuses on developing a pneumonia detection system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
trained on a comprehensive chest X-ray dataset. The primary objective is to accurately identify pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images.
The process begins with preprocessing steps where we isolate and mask the images to focus on the lung regions, 
thereby reducing noise and unnecessary information. Subsequently, these preprocessed images are fed into our CNN model for pneumonia detection.
Our CNN model has been trained on a diverse dataset comprising thousands of chest X-ray images, encompassing both pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative cases. 
Through extensive training and optimization, our model has achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 75% in detecting pneumonia cases.
The significance of our project lies in its potential application in healthcare settings, 
where early and accurate detection of pneumonia can significantly aid in timely medical intervention and patient care. 
By leveraging the power of deep learning and chest X-ray imaging, our system offers a promising tool for assisting healthcare professionals in 
diagnosing pneumonia more efficiently and accurately.
